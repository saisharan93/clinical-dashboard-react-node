# Clinical Dashboard – Full Stack Prototype

This project is a full-stack clinical-style dashboard designed to simulate
patient encounters, vitals, and observations using healthcare-inspired data models.

The goal is to demonstrate rapid clinical prototyping, clean UI architecture,
and API-first backend design similar to systems used in real clinical environments.

## Features
- React-based frontend with modular components
- Node.js API with structured REST endpoints
- Mock clinical data (patients, encounters, observations)
- Authentication-ready API design
- Accessibility-aware UI patterns

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
Backend: Node.js, Express  
API: REST (GraphQL-ready)  
Auth: JWT (planned)

## Status
Active development – initial prototype
